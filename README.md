English Dictionaries Project (AOO+Mozilla+others)

For many years that people stopped maintaining dictionaries for open-source software.

It would be great to continue their work and improve existing dictionaries or create new ones.

The biggest issue is that most of these dictionaries are obfuscated (codified in a way that only certain software packages can access the wordlists) and the original developers are long-gone to provide the clean text ones.

In some cases, we will have to start from a long-time gone position, the last known clean text version of the dictionary.

Modifying, updating and maintaining a dictionary is a hard task but an important one for current and future generations.

The dictionaries here are the most recent versions available, and this repository makes it easier for developers to find all in one place and take the .AFF and .DIC files to use them in projects with proofing — or spellchecking — functionalities.

I (Marco Pinto) am only improving the en_GB. Kevin Atkinson maintains the en_AU, en_US and en_CA. Please contact Kevin directly for the latter three: https://github.com/en-wl/wordlist, http://wordlist.aspell.net. Dwayne Bailey no longer maintains the en_ZA and I have done a few fixes it it myself.

I will release monthly updates. AOO admins may disable automatic updates when they are about to release a new version of AOO, so that when you install their package, you won't be prompted to update the dictionaries.

Notice the <B>"en_GB_speller_for_Mozilla+AOO+LO_2013+.txt"</B> above, where I keep a changelog.

I keep notes of the most recent releases for Mozilla, BlueGriffon, AOO and LO on the Proofing Tool GUI (PTG) website: https://proofingtoolgui.org


#### Each GitHub folder has:
* .AFF + .DIC + README + WORDLIST.  
  
  
#### Licences for the wordlists:
* en_AU (Kevin Atkinson) — BSD/MIT-Like;
* en_CA (Kevin Atkinson) — BSD/MIT-Like;
* en_GB (Marco A.G.Pinto) — LGPL;
* en_US (Kevin Atkinson) — BSD/MIT-Like;

#### Suggesting words:

(First check the wordlist .txt file inside the folder of the latest en_GB. If the words aren't there, check <B>"en_GB_speller_for_Mozilla+AOO+LO_2013+.txt"</B> topping this page).  
If <B>NOT</B> found:
* Open an issue or e-mail Marco Pinto ( <B>marcoagpinto AT sapo.pt</B> ) with the suggested words.
  

#### Projects using GB/Proofing Tool GUI:

If you know of any projects that use them, please let me know, and I will list them on the official PTG page.
